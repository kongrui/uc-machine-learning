## P1 Steps
- Unsupervised learning techniques
- Segment/Categorize customer over study on product spending data
- First determine if any product categories highly correlate with one another. (don't know why)
- Then preprocess the data by scaling each product category and then identifying (and removing) unwanted outliers. With the good, clean customer spending data, you will apply PCA transformations to the data and implement clustering algorithms to segment the transformed customer data.
- You will compare the segmentation found with an additional labeling
- Discover if any similarities exist between customers, and how to best segment customers into distinct categories.

## P2 Goal
- How to feature scaling and outlier detection.
- How to interpret data points that have been scaled, transformed, or reduced from PCA.
- How to analyze PCA dimensions and construct a new feature space.
- How to optimally cluster a set of data to find hidden patterns in a dataset.
- How to assess information given by cluster data and use it in a meaningful way.

## P3 Background
- Wholesale distributor moved from a morning delivery service five days a week to a cheaper evening delivery service three days a week
- customers were canceling deliveries
- Since one size will not fit all, distributor like to segment customer and give them diffrent service
