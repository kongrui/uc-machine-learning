- The predictions_3 function has been correctly implemented and obtains a prediction accuracy of at least 80%.
Please make a discussion on how you approached the problem and cracked it!
- A valid scenario where supervised learning can be applied is reported.
A clear outcome variable and at least two potential predictor variables are identified as part of the description.
Please elaborate more on your suggestion.

# second review
- It is good approach to consider different subcategories that might increase the overall information of the model. 
It is awesome that you consider also subcategories with low survival rate.
